# Item Type
 This is an item type implemented with the `p-definition-table` component. The layout is dynamically generated according to the `options.fields` defined in the schema. For the options of `options.fields`, please refer to the `Dynamic Field` component.

If `options.fields` is not provided, the layout is generated as a key-value pair of 1 depth by default. Therefore, it can be used when the data is in the following code.

```json
{
  "key1": "value1",
  "key2": "value2",
  "key3": "value3"
}
```
