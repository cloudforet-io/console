# Collapsible Panel
Collapsible Panel is a component that can be expanded or collapsed.

<br/>
<br/>

# Types
There are two types based on behavior:
- [simpleClamp](#line-clamp)
- [recursive](#recursive)

<br/>
<br/>

## Basic
<Canvas of={PCollapsiblePanelStories.Basic} />

<br/>
<br/>

## Line Clamp
<Canvas of={PCollapsiblePanelStories.LineClamp} />

<br/>
<br/>

# Recursive
```recursive (Boolean)```

This prop controls the text clamping (truncation) method. <br/>
When set to `true`, text clamping is applied recursively to nested elements, <br/>
**treating text within both inline and block elements as a single line.** <br/>
When set to `false`, text clamping only applies to the top-level element, improving performance.

**Tip**: Use `recursive: true` when dealing with nested text structures or multi-level elements to enforce text length constraints.
**Motivation**: The simple clamping method had issues where clamping was not applied properly when multiple nested child elements were present.
