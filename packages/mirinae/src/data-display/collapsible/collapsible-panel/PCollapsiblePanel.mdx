# Collapsible Panel
Collapsible Panel is a component that can be expanded or collapsed.

<br/>
<br/>

# Types
There are two types based on behavior:
- [SimpleClamp](#line-clamp)
- [DeepClamp](#deepclamp)

<br/>
<br/>

## Basic
<Canvas of={PCollapsiblePanelStories.Basic} />

<br/>
<br/>

## Line Clamp
<Canvas of={PCollapsiblePanelStories.LineClamp} />

<br/>
<br/>

## DeepClamp
```DeepClamp (Boolean)```

This prop controls the text clamping (truncation) method. <br/>
When set to `true`, text clamping is applied recursively to nested elements, <br/>
**treating text within both inline and block elements as a single line.** <br/>
When set to `false`, text clamping only applies to the top-level element, improving performance.

**Tip**: Use `enableDeepClamp: true` when dealing with nested text structures or multi-level elements to enforce text length constraints.
**Motivation**: The simple clamping method had issues where clamping was not applied properly when multiple nested child elements were present.

<br/>

## DeepClamp Basic
<Canvas of={PCollapsiblePanelStories.DeepClampBasic} />

<br/>
<br/>

## Nested Elements
<Canvas of={PCollapsiblePanelStories.NestedElements} />

<br/>
<br/>

## Multi Inline Elements
<Canvas of={PCollapsiblePanelStories.MultiInlineElements} />

<br/>
<br/>

## Advanced
The example below demonstrates how `CollapsiblePanel` integrates with `PLink` for interactive content
