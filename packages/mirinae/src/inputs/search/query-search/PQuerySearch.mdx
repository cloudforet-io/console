# Query Search
<br/>

Query Search is <b>```key:value``` format search.</b> <br/>
<Canvas of={PQuerySearchStories.Basic} />


1. After selecting a key first,
2. you can search the value for the selected key.

<br/>
Plain text search is of course also provided.<br/>
<br/>
It provides <b>search suggestion for keys and values.</b> <br/>
<br/>
Also, you can give an <b>operator</b> between key and value. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>

## Key item sets
For ```key:value``` searches, ```keyItemSets``` must be given as props. <br/>
```keyItemSets``` is an array of ```keyItemSet```. <br/>
```keyItemSet``` is a set of title and key items. <br/>
```title``` of key item set is useful when you want to distinguish and display the characteristics of key items. <br/>
```items``` of key item set is an array of objects containing information of keys.<br/>
If you input a value that is not in key items and press enter, it is regarded as a general keyword search.<br/>

```typescript
import {KeyDataType,OperatorType} from "./type";
interface KeyItem {
    label: string;
    name: any;
    dataType?: KeyDataType; // See the description of data types below
    operators?: OperatorType[]; // See the description of Operators below
}

interface KeyItemSet {
    title: string;
    items: KeyItem[];
}
```
<Canvas of={PQuerySearchStories.WithSeveralKeyItemSets} />

## How suggestion works?
When you input a value, search recommendation will be provided.<br/>
Suggestion works differently for <b>key search(selection)</b> and <b>value search</b>.<br/>
Value search suggestion also works differently depending on data type of selected key.<br/>

### Key items suggestion
A key item that is not in ```keyItemSets``` cannot be selected as a key.<br/>
Among the key items in the ```keyItemSets``` given as props, the suggestion menu shows those whose ```label``` property contains an input value.<br/>
If there is no input value, all key items will be displayed.<br/>

### Value items suggestion
Value items suggestion can be different by selected key item. <br/>
So you must give ```valueHandlerMap``` as props for suggestion list. <br/>
Also, it works differently for each selected key item's data type.<br/>
See the description of data types below.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

## Value handler map
A value handler map is an object.<br/>
The properties must be one of the ```name``` of key items.<br/>
This object's value must be a ```ValueHandler``` or ```undefined```. <br/>
If you don't want to suggest a values for a certain key, do not assign the key as a property or give ```undefined```.<br/>
<br/>

### Value handler
The value handler is a ```function``` that returns suggestion items.<br/>

#### Arguments
The handler receives the input value as the first argument, perhaps to retrieve the search result.<br/>
As the second argument, it receives the first selected key item.<br/>
The third argument is the data type of the last selected key. <br/>
The fourth argument, subPath, is a string connecting the names of the selected key items with a dot(.).<br/>
The fifth argument is the operator entered by the user.<br/>
<br/>

#### Return object
The handler must return an object whose type is ```HandlerResponse```.<br/>
This object must contain an array of value items(```Array<ValueMenuItem>```) to suggest as the ```results``` property.<br/>
```totalCount``` is the total number of value items searched with input value.<br/>
It is useful to show only the top few of the searched items, and to tell users that the total number of searched items is 300.<br/>
It is displayed in the suggestion title, but if you do not want to display it, do not provide this property.<br/>
```dataType``` and ```operators``` are specifications for nested key selection.<br/>
If ```dataType``` is ```object```, it is considered as nested key selection, not value search.<br/>
And ```operators``` are list of available operators in the next search.<br/>


```typescript
import {ContextMenuType,KeyDataType,KeyItem,OperatorType} from "./type";
interface T{
}
interface ValueMenuItem {
    label: string;
    name: any;
    type?: ContextMenuType; // See menu type of context menu component
    data?: T;
}

interface HandlerResponse {
    results: Array<ValueMenuItem>;
    totalCount?: number;
    dataType?: KeyDataType; // See the description of data types below
    operators?: OperatorType[]; // See the description of Operators below
}

interface ValueHandler {
    (inputText: string,
     rootKey: KeyItem,
     dataType?: KeyDataType,
     subPath?: string,
     operator?: OperatorType): Promise<HandlerResponse>|HandlerResponse;
}

interface ValueHandlerMap {
    [key: string]: ValueHandler|undefined;
}
```
<Canvas of={PQuerySearchStories.ValueHandler} />

<br/>

## Nested key selection
This component supports not only ```key:value``` search, but also ```key.a.b.c:value``` search. <br/>

1. First, search for key items through ```keyItemSets```.
2. Select one of the suggested key items. -> key
3. If the ```dataType``` of the selected key item is ```object```, the next search is also considered to be a key search.
4. Items retrieved through the value handler corresponding to the root key are suggested.
5. Choose one of the suggested items. -> key.a
6. If the ```dataType``` of the selected item is ```object```, steps 3-5 are repeated. -> key.a.b.c
7. If the ```dataType``` of the selected item is not ```object```, it is regarded as a value item and the search is completed. -> key.a.b.c:value
<Canvas of={PQuerySearchStories.NestedKeySearch} />

<br/>
<br/>

## Data types
```dataType``` is an optional property for key item and value item(only when the selected key's data type is ```object```). <br/>
This is used to determine the browser input form to be displayed to the user.<br/>
It's NOT used for validation. It's only for input form determination. <br/>

### Support data type
- string(default)
- integer
- float
- boolean
- datetime
- object

### HTML input attributes for each data type
| Data Type | HTML Input Attributes |
| --------- | --------------- |
| string(default) | type: text |
| integer | type: number, step: 1, min: 0 |
| float | type: number |
| boolean | type: text |
| datetime | type: text |
| object(key) | type: text |
| object(value) | type: text |

### Data types that support value item suggestions
- string(default)
- integer
- float
- object

### How data types without value items suggestions work
| Selected Key's Data Type | How It Works                                                       |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| boolean                  | TRUE/FALSE ```text``` suggestion.                                  |
| datetime                 | Operator suggestion will be given. There will be value validation. |
<Canvas of={PQuerySearchStories.DataTypes} />

<br/>
<br/>

## Supported operators
We provide the following operators:
```undefined```, '!', '>', '>=', '\<', '\<=', '=', '!=', '~'

It is recommended to use these operators in the following meanings.

| Operator | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| (default) | contain |
| ! | not contain |
| = | equal |
| != | not equal |
| > | greater than |
| >= | greater than or equal |
| \< | less than |
| \<= | less than or equal |
| ~ | regex |


### Operator restrictions

You can restrict operators the user can enter in two ways.<br/>

1. You can give an operator array to ```operators``` property on the value handler's return object(useful with nested key selection).
2. You can give an operator array to ```operators``` property of key item.

Be careful when using them as they have the highest priority in the order they are listed.
