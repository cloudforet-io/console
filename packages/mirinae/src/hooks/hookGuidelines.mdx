# Hook Guidelines

This document outlines the guidelines for creating and using hooks within the design system, as well as for external usage, ensuring consistency and clarity across all hooks.
<br/>

## 1. Hook Argument - Options

- **Single Argument**: Every hook accepts a single argument, which is always an object. This object is referred to as the "Hook Options."
- **Naming Convention**: The interface for these options follows the naming rule `HookNameOptions`, where `HookName` is the name of the specific hook.
  - **Example**: `UseTabOptions`
<br/>

## 2. Hook Returns

- **Return Format**: Hooks always return a single object, called the "Hook Returns."
- **Naming Convention**: The interface for the return object follows the naming rule `HookNameReturns`, where `HookName` is the name of the specific hook.
  - **Example**: `UseTabReturns`
