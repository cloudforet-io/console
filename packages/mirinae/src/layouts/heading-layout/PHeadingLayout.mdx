# Heading Layout

The `<Heading Layout>` component is designed for use with **the compound component pattern**, allowing developers to easily arrange the **[Heading](?path=/docs/data-display-heading--docs) component** alongside other elements, such as buttons or text.

There are basic layout rules for how these elements should be positioned when used together. However, the `<Heading Layout>` component automatically applies these rules, ensuring consistent alignment and spacing.


<br/>
<br/>

## Basic

The `<Heading Layout>` component has two **slots**:
1. **heading**: A slot for inserting the `<Heading>` component.
2. **extra**: A slot for placing elements aligned to the right.

The layout rules are as follows:
1. The elements inside the **extra** slot are right-aligned with consistent spacing.
2. The width of the **extra** slot remains fixed, even if the **heading** lengthens (`shrink: 0`).
3. When the **heading** reaches 360px, the **extra** slot moves below the **heading**.
